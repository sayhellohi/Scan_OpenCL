Hillis and Blelloch Scan implementation

This repo contains the parallel implementation of Hillis and Blelloch Scan algorithm.

Implementation is done in Visual Studio Express Edition 2012.

To run the code simply load the .sln file and run it.

An output file will be created which will contain the output and the execution time.
